### Setting Up Your Environment

To get started with the TabbyAPI inference engine, you'll need to set up your development environment properly. This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to install the required software, configure your environment, and optimize your setup for optimal performance.

---

#### 1. Python Setup

Before you begin, ensure that you have Python 3.10 or newer installed on your system. Python is the primary language used for interacting with TabbyAPI, and having the correct version is essential for compatibility.

- **Install Python 3.10 or newer**
  You can download Python from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org](https://www.python.org). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

- **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
  Using a virtual environment helps isolate your project dependencies and prevents version conflicts. To create a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python -m venv myenv
  ```
  Activate the virtual environment:
  - On Windows:
    ```cmd
    myenv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  - On macOS/Linux:
    ```bash
    source myenv/bin/activate
    ```

- **Install required Python packages**
  Once your virtual environment is set up, install the necessary Python packages. You can install them using `pip`:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file listing all the dependencies for your project.

#### 2. Install ExLlamaV2

ExLlamaV2 is a high-performance library optimized for running large language models on consumer-grade hardware. Follow these steps to install it:

- **Clone the ExLlamaV2 repository**
  Use Git to clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/exllamav2/exllamav2.git
  cd exllamav2
  ```

- **Install dependencies**
  ExLlamaV2 requires several dependencies to be installed. Install them using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- **Build the required CUDA extensions**
  To enable GPU acceleration, you'll need to build the CUDA extensions. Ensure that you have CUDA toolkit installed on your system. Then, run:
  ```bash
  python setup.py install
  ```
  If you encounter any issues during the build process, check that your CUDA version is compatible with the library requirements.

#### 3. Install and Configure TabbyAPI

Now that ExLlamaV2 is installed, it's time to set up TabbyAPI.

- **Install TabbyAPI using pip**
  Install TabbyAPI from PyPI:
  ```bash
  pip install tabbyapi
  ```

- **Configure the server settings**
  After installation, you'll need to configure the server. Create a configuration file (e.g., `config.json`) with the following settings:
  ```json
  {
    "host": "0.0.0.0",
    "port": 8000,
    "model_path": "/path/to/your/model",
    "gpu": true
  }
  ```
  Adjust the settings according to your needs.

- **Set up API keys and access controls**
  For security, it's important to set up API keys and access controls. Generate an API key and store it securely. You can configure access controls in your server settings to restrict access to authorized users only.

#### 4. Model Management

TabbyAPI allows you to manage and optimize models for inference.

- **Download models from Hugging Face using TabbyAPI**
  You can download models directly from Hugging Face using TabbyAPI's CLI or API interface. For example:
  ```bash
  tabbyapi download-model --name "model-name" --repo "username/model"
  ```

- **Configure model parameters**
  Once a model is downloaded, you can configure its parameters to suit your use case. This includes settings like precision, batch size, and temperature. Refer to the TabbyAPI documentation for a full list of configurable parameters.

- **Optimize for your hardware**
  To achieve the best performance, optimize your setup based on your hardware. For example:
  - Use GPU acceleration if available.
  - Adjust model quantization settings to balance speed and accuracy.
  - Experiment with different batch sizes to find the optimal configuration for your workload.

With these steps completed, you should be ready to start using TabbyAPI for inference tasks. If you encounter any issues during the setup process, refer to the troubleshooting guide or reach out to the community for support.
